TAs at Lighthouse Labs are in high demand especially while students are working on daily assignments. Coo4Help app creates a system for managing learning content. 

The app can determine whether you're a student or Teacher's Assistant based on your login credentials. Its main feature allows students to request assistance from the TAs where a call is put in the cue for TAs to attend to in the order the call was received. 

TA's can view a list of requests that is automatically updated when new requests are added and removes requests that have been handled by a TA. They are able to time and add notes to a request and it is automatically added to "history" where all archived requests are saved and date-stamped.
